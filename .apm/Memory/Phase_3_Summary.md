# Phase 3 Summary: Finalization & Polish

**Status:** Completed

## Summary
Phase 3 focused on finalizing the application by improving its robustness, user-friendliness, and documentation. All planned tasks were completed, bringing the project to a successful conclusion.

### Key Accomplishments:
- **Task 3.1 (Error Handling and User Feedback):** The application now provides clear error messages to the user via dialog boxes, and all buttons have helpful tooltips.
- **Task 3.2 (Unit Tests):** A new test file with unit tests for the refactored core logic was created, ensuring the reliability of the backend functions.
- **Task 3.3 (Documentation):** The `README.md` file was updated with instructions for running the GUI, and the `gui.py` file was thoroughly documented with docstrings and comments.

## Outcome
The application is now a polished and robust tool that is ready for end-users. The code is well-documented, making it easier for future developers to maintain and extend.
