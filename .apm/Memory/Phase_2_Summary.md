# Phase 2 Summary: Core Feature Integration

**Status:** Completed

## Summary
Phase 2 successfully integrated all core functionalities of the ProductScraper tool into the PyQt6 GUI. All planned tasks were completed, making the application functional.

### Key Accomplishments:
- **Task 2.1 (Start Scraping):** The "Start Scraping" button is now fully functional, allowing users to select a file and initiate the scraping process in a background thread.
- **Task 2.2 (Discontinued Check):** The "Check Discontinued" button has been integrated, providing a one-click method for running the discontinued product check.
- **Task 2.3 (Database Refresh):** The "Refresh Database" button is now functional, allowing users to refresh the database from the GUI.
- **Task 2.4 (Scraper Tests):** The "Run Tests" button has been integrated, enabling users to run scraper tests directly from the application.

## Outcome
The application is now feature-complete from an MVP perspective. The GUI can now trigger all the core backend functions, and the use of a worker thread ensures the UI remains responsive. The next phase will focus on improving the user experience through error handling and other polishing touches.
