# Task 3.1: Implement Error Handling and User Feedback - Completion

**Status:** Completed

**Summary:** The `gui.py` file was updated to improve user feedback. A `QMessageBox.critical()` dialog is now displayed when an error occurs in a worker thread, providing a clear and user-friendly error message. Additionally, tooltips have been added to all buttons to explain their functionality.
