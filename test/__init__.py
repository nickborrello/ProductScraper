# Package marker to help editors and importers treat this folder as a package.
# This file is intentionally empty; it makes `test` a package so imports like
# `import test_scraper_fields` or `from test import test_scraper_fields` are
# more likely to be resolved by static analysis tools.

# NOTE: There's a name conflict with the standard library package named
# `test`. If your editor still prefers the stdlib `test` package, consider
# using a different directory name (e.g. `tests`) and updating imports.
